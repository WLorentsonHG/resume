          <strong>Software Engineer, II</strong> | InTouch Health - <small>Feb 2017 - Present</small>
          <br>
In my current role I have brought DevOps practices to bare metal operating system builds. Managment of services on AWS, mitigating security breaches,
implementing security fixes via automation, and producing tooling to help multiple teams more effectively understand their own infrastructure. I have
designed and coded projects that are now being adopted by other teams. Between Slackbots, port-monitoring dashboards, screen scraping, and API building,
I appreciate that this job allows me to sharpen my toolset and introduce new ways to solve legacy challenges.
